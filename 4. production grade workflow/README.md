## updating code to docker real time

once you update code in your local machine, absolutely nothing make change in container 
in order to get the update, we are going to do straig copy
we need to adjust docker run command that we used it to run the container
called "volume"

concept::
in container base file will reference to local machine so any change we made it will update in container too

like container port mapping concept::
map the port inside the container to port outside the container
==
map the folder inside the container to folder outside the container

go to readme.md in root folder and find docker volume
